*a simple cmd-line app that obscures strings within the defined range into a hard to crack sequence.*


# notice:
***do not use this app for security of sensitive data. though it repels most noobs, it would take only minutes for a professional to crack. do not confuse obscurity with encryption***

to defend your data from fellow users of this script, i recommend reassigning the values in the baseMap variable.

you might even play around with the transformations a bit also.
